# Credit_Risk_Analysis
## Overview of Project
LendingClub, a peer-to-peer lending services company, would like to develop a few machine learning models to predict credit risk. Credit risk is an unbalanced since the number of good loans outnumber the risky loans. Multiple techniques will be employed to determine which model(s) perform better at predicting credit risk. The dataset was first oversampled using the RandomOverSampler and SMOTE. The dataset was then undersampled using ClusterCentroids. SMOTEENN algorithm was used next which combines both over- and undersampling of the data.
